This repository contains notes, ipynb files and pdfs that I made as I read "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jonathan Taylor. 


*This report explores the basics of Statistical Machine learning through an interactive resource, ISLP. A freely available book which has an introduction to statistical learning along with python exercises for the reader. The report will go through key concepts and present them in a precise and simple manner, if possible, with some analogy or other.*
